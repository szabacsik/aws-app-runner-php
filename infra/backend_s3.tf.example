# Optional remote backend definition for S3. Copy this file to backend_s3.tf to enable S3 backend.
# Remote state is recommended for teams, but this project defaults to local state for simplicity.
# To enable remote state:
#  1) Copy this file to infra/backend_s3.tf
#  2) Create and edit infra/backend.hcl with your bucket/key/region/table (see backend.hcl.example)
#  3) Run: make tf-init
